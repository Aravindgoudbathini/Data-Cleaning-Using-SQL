World Life Expectancy Data Cleaning Project
Overview
This SQL-based data cleaning project focuses on preparing and standardizing a world life expectancy dataset for analysis. The script addresses common data quality issues found in real-world datasets, transforming raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format suitable for statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization.
Dataset Context
The worldlifexpectancy table contains historical life expectancy data across multiple countries and years. This type of longitudinal dataset is valuable for:

Tracking global health trends over time
Comparing development patterns between countries
Analyzing the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes
Supporting policy decisions and public health research

Data Quality Challenges Addressed
1. Duplicate Record Management
Problem: Multiple entries for the same country-year combination create data integrity issues and can skew statistical analyses.
Solution: Implemented a sophisticated deduplication process using window functions (ROW_NUMBER()) to identify and remove duplicate records while preserving the first occurrence of each unique country-year pair.
2. Missing Status Classifications
Problem: Some countries lack development status classification (Developed vs. Developing), creating incomplete categorical data.
Solution: Developed a self-referential update mechanism that fills missing status values by referencing other years' data for the same country, ensuring consistent classification across all records.
3. Incomplete Life Expectancy Data
Problem: Missing life expectancy values create gaps in the time series, making trend analysis difficult.
Solution: Applied linear interpolation methodology to estimate missing values by averaging the life expectancy from adjacent years (previous and following years) for the same country.
Technical Methodology
Data Exploration Phase

Comprehensive dataset examination to understand structure and content
Identification of data quality issues through targeted queries
Analysis of existing data patterns to inform cleaning strategies

Data Cleaning Implementation

Duplicate Detection: Used concatenated country-year strings with grouping to identify duplicates
Status Imputation: Leveraged self-joins to propagate known status values within countries
Value Interpolation: Employed three-table joins to calculate averages from surrounding data points

Quality Assurance

Incremental validation after each cleaning step
Preservation of data relationships and referential integrity
Rounding and formatting standardization for consistency

Business Impact
This data cleaning process transforms unreliable raw data into a trustworthy dataset that enables:

Accurate Trend Analysis: Clean time series data supports reliable longitudinal studies
Comparative Research: Consistent country classifications enable meaningful cross-country comparisons
Policy Development: High-quality health data supports evidence-based decision making
Research Foundation: Provides a solid foundation for academic and institutional research

Technical Skills Demonstrated

Advanced SQL Techniques: Window functions, self-joins, conditional updates
Data Quality Assessment: Systematic identification of data anomalies
Statistical Methods: Linear interpolation for missing value estimation
Database Management: Efficient bulk operations and transaction management
Documentation: Comprehensive code commenting and process documentation

Future Applications
This cleaned dataset can serve as the foundation for:

Predictive modeling of life expectancy trends
Correlation analysis with economic and social indicators
Geographic information system (GIS) mapping projects
Dashboard development for public health monitoring
Machine learning applications in demographic forecasting

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the critical importance of data preprocessing in analytics workflows. By systematically addressing data quality issues, we've transformed a potentially unreliable dataset into a robust foundation for meaningful analysis and decision-making in global health research.
